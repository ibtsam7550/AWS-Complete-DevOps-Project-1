# AWS CI/CD Pipeline for Microservices using CodeCommit, CodeBuild, ECR, ECS Fargate & ALB

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a **complete end-to-end CI/CD pipeline on AWS** for deploying a **containerized microservice** using modern DevOps best practices.

The pipeline automates the entire workflow — from **code commit to production deployment** — including testing, manual approval, load balancing, and DNS routing.  
The architecture follows a **microservices approach**, not a monolithic design.
