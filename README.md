# AWS CI/CD Pipeline for Microservices using CodeCommit, CodeBuild, ECR, ECS Fargate & ALB
##Project Overview
This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end CI/CD pipeline on AWS for deploying a containerized microservice using modern DevOps practices.
The pipeline automates everything from code commit to production deployment, including testing, manual approval, load balancing, and DNS routing, following a microservices architecture (not monolithic).
